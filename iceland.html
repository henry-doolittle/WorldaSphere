<h1>Iceland: The Land of Fire and Ice</h1>
<p>Iceland is home to a magestic landscape, and it is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I am yet to find a place with fresher air and more welcoming people. Although some may see it as a barren, dry landscape, it is actually the most amazing country on our list. </p>
<p><strong>Day Two: </strong>At around 9:00 AM, your flight should land in the airport. Your should definitely rent a car because there is a lot of driving to do. There is a margharita pizza shop at gate D, level 1 of the airport. Check in to Hotel Muli, a great hotel and then head to your glacier tour. Keep about 2 hours to drive there. Go to Domino's Pizza, Skeifan, 108 Reykjav√≠k, Iceland for dinner.</p>

<p><strong>Day Three: </strong>For breakfast, enjoy a cup of Skyr, a traditional Icelandic food, which your can get at any supermarket. From 9:40-2:00, enjoy yourself at Thingvellir Park, where you can go snorkelling between the tectonic plates at Silfra Fissure, a surreal experience. You can also stand between the tectonic plates, something very unique to this park. Oxarafoss Waterfall is a man-made waterfall that is worth seeing. Also, Althing is the site of the first parliment in the world, located in Thingvellir, and one of the most unique attractions in Iceland. Next, start the 50 min drive to Strokkur, reaching at 3:00, and watch the epic geysers for 1.5 hours. Eat some food and then head to Gulfoss, a waterfall, and leave at 6:00. Check out Hallgrumskirkja Church, Sun Voyager sculpture, and Harpa Concert Hall and then head to bed. </p>
<p><strong>Day Four: </strong>Head to Hali Country Hotel in Hofn, a 4-hour drive. Reach at 11:40 AM. Go to Seljalandsfoss Hike, and walk along the 15 min path to the waterfall. Then, take a 5 min hike to another waterfall, Glijufrafoss, and then leave at 12:40. Reach Skogafoss waterfall at 1:05, at truly amazing place, and visit Skogur museum. Visit Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur to see some amazing puffins, although this is a bumpy drive. Then, go to Reynisfjara black sand beach, with some amazing stones, and then get back to your hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Day Five: </strong>Drive to Diamond beach at 8:45 AM, a 10 min drive. At 10:45, drive to the boat tours, which start at 11:30 for 1 hr. Drive to Heppuvegur 2a | H√∂fn 780 | Iceland for lunch, pizza. Then drive to Stokksnes, a 30 min drive, and then head to Akureri, a 6-hour drive. Stay at the Disney Icelandair Akureri Hotel. Eat at Bryggjan, open at midnight. </p>
<a href="https://adventures.is/iceland/day-tours/boat-tours/jokulsarlon-amphibian-boat-tour/">This the tour</a>
<p><strong>Day Six: </strong>Head to Godafoss, a majestic waterfall. Visit Myvatn, a lake, Namaskard, and then head back to the hotel. Then, walk to the community center and experience the amazing place with epic waterslides and pools, geothermally heated, and the legendary ground trampolines, only seen in Iceland, a place that you should not miss. After a day there, head back to the hotel to relax. Also, I recommend the ice cream shop in Akureri, it was delicious. For lunch, you eat at the small shop, Lasagna and more. Also, on the streets of Akureri, you could see Gryla, the Nordic witch.</p>
<p><strong>Day Seven: </strong>Keep 30 minutes for driving to board your 9:30 Hauganes Whale Watching Tour, in which you get to see some rare whales and fish in the Greenland Sea. Drive back to Reykjavil and head to Bifrost Hotel for food. Check in to Hotel Alda. </p>
<p><strong>Day Six: </strong>Drive for 40 mins to Blue Lagoon, and relax with a mud mask and a slushie in the geothermally heated, esteemed lagoon. After that, head out of Iceland, back home. </p>
