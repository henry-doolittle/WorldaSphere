<h1>Oahu: The Gathering Place</h1>
<p>Oahu is a beautiful island with pristine beaches and crystal clear oceans. Visiting Oahu is a truly rejuvinating experience in the perfect temperature all year round. Oahu makes the perfect vacation place for anyone who likes water sports.</p>

<p><strong>Day Two: </strong>Wake up in the morning to a delicious breakfast and then head to your shark diving tour with North Shore Shark Adventures. Keep 45 minutes for driving time. When you arrive back, enjoy the waterslides for a bit, and then head to your spa appointment to relax. After that, have lunch at Mama Mia's and then try and have a crack at the Menehune Adventure Trail, a fun, high-tech scavenger hunt.</p>
<p><strong>Day Three: </strong>Today, head to your surfing lesson in the morning, which lasts about 1.5 hours, and try to stand up! Later in the day, head to Rainbow Reef to to see the fishes. Then, go to the beach where you can rent a stand-up paddle board and try it out. </p>
